# About this project

Aaron's Kit is a project dedicated to the liberation of research. The project is in tribute to the late internet hactivist, Aaron Swartz, who believed that scholarship a.k.a knowledge is a public good, and should be shared freely and openly with the world.

The project strives to become the world's first and largest repository of complete journals behind paywalls that will be available to the public for free. 

Functionally, Aaron's Kit is a decentralized scraper, designed to retrieve articles from JSTOR. Practically, it is a tool that will allow any author/researcher/user to download scholarly articles sitting behind JSTORâ€™s paywall. In other words, Aaron's Kit enables users with JSTOR subscriptions and university affiliations, to effortlessly free paywalled research.
